<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!--[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->

Thriftcore is the name given to a basic website , made for second hand buying and selling of all things fashion . curated exlusively for the gen Z crowd , with sections for different aesthetics .


This project was made for a college course by Purva and Lakshaya .


Most of it is made in html , sql server as backend and python in connection between them . 


The website is mostly static for now to meet the requirements for the course , however we plan to make quite few changes to website as we learn new skills and tools in full stack development .

some key features:
* diffrent sections for 4 aesthetics 1 cottagecore 2.goth 3.vintage 4.y2k
* seperate pages for sellers and stores to keep track of sold wares .
* cart and wishlist page . 

some features we'll be incorporating in the future:
* review section in the store section and rating for stores 
* an API that sorts all clothes accoding to aesthtics , price range size etc 
* A nned help Page or FAQ page , and complaint section 

This website will be updated with features as we get free time from college work .
